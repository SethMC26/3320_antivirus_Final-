Add whitelist functionality to skip trusted files during scan
- Implemented a whitelist feature to skip scanning files and directories listed in `/usr/local/share/pproc/whitelist.txt`.
- Updated `scan_file` function to check against the whitelist before scanning each file.
- Created `is_whitelisted` function to verify if a file or directory is whitelisted.
- Adjusted `install.sh` to create the whitelist file during installation.
